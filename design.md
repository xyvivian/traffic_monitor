Project 2: Network Firewall Module

Tao Chen (section 02) Xueying Ding (section 02)

We are using C++ as our main programming language for this project. We decide to implement two source files: one for module class, the other for proc filesystem. The /proc filesystem is for the ability to filter incoming/outgoing traffic from/to specific addresses. When the user modifies the appropriate file in /proc, our module should re-read the file and make sure it's filtering what is currently specified. To build a basic kernel module in module class, we will mimic the Netfilterâ€™s functions. Specifically, we will start by implementing the init_module(), and cleanup_module() (so far we only figure it out two, but there is definitely more functions here). 

How System can be integrated and tested:

The kernel module system needs to be integrated by using a special makefile(similar to the Hello,world example in the http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html.) This will make the module with special .ko extension, so we can distinguish it from the regular .o files. 

To test our program, we needs the insmod, lsmod, rmmod commands which loads,checks or removes the existing kernel modules from terminal. We can check the corresponding functionalities after the successful compilation and loading process.
