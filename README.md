### Project Overview: <br>
For this final project, the goal is to implement a linux kernel module that monitors or filters network traffic. Implementing two parts of functionality is necessary for this project, the kernel module and the user interaction. The kernel module is planted to implement certain functions such as reading and writing to proc files and filtering net traffic to do all the monitoring, logging, and filtering, and the user interaction part will be the way for the user to interact with and configure the module's functionality at runtime. <br>
